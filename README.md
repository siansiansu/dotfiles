# dotfiles

Add my personal setting with git version control.


## Getting Started
I'd like to add git to my personal home dir. I can push the changed configurations to GitHub directly. Please write your `.gitignore` carefully, in case you push your sensitive files to GitHub. 

## Prerequisites

Please install some prerequisites first such as git, zsh, vim, etc. In macOS, I like to use [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

For example:
```bash
brew install git zsh tmux
```

## Installation

Clone this repo into your home dir without project folder.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:siansiansu/dotfiles.git $HOME
```

## Contributing

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature)
3. Commit your Changes (git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature')
4. Push to the Branch (git push origin feature/AmazingFeature)
5. Open a Pull Request
